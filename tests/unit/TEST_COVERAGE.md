# Availability Tests Coverage

## Test Suite Summary

### ✅ All Tests Passing (35/35)

## Test Files

### 1. `members.spec.ts` - Firebase Members Service Tests
Tests the core availability update logic in the members service.

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Preserves existing availabilities when updating other fields
- ✅ Handles undefined availabilities without data loss
- ✅ Properly updates availabilities when explicitly provided
- ✅ Handles empty availabilities object correctly
- ✅ Handles member with null availabilities
- ✅ Adds single availability without affecting others
- ✅ Removes single availability without affecting others
- ✅ Handles concurrent updates correctly
- ✅ Proper error handling for non-existent members
- ✅ Graceful Firestore error handling

### 2. `DisponibilitesPage.spec.ts` - Vue Component Tests
Tests the DisponibilitesPage component's availability management UI and logic.

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Loads member availabilities correctly
- ✅ Handles null availabilities safely
- ✅ Handles undefined availabilities safely
- ✅ **October 26 Service Bug Fix**: Does not lose other availabilities when updating
- ✅ Toggles availability correctly for October 26 service
- ✅ Handles multiple rapid updates without data loss
- ✅ Reverts local state on update error
- ✅ Handles member data reload correctly
- ✅ Updates UI immediately on availability change
- ✅ Syncs originalAvailabilities after successful save
- ✅ Handles empty string values gracefully
- ✅ Handles very long service IDs

### 3. `availability-edge-cases.spec.ts` - Edge Cases & Data Integrity
Comprehensive edge case testing for data integrity and unusual scenarios.

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Null and undefined handling in existing members
- ✅ Invalid data type handling (string, array, number instead of object)
- ✅ Large datasets (100+ availabilities)
- ✅ Clearing many availabilities at once
- ✅ Special characters and encoding in service IDs
- ✅ Very long service IDs (500+ characters)
- ✅ Sequential updates simulation
- ✅ Data recovery from corrupted availability data
- ✅ **Critical**: October 26 service data is never lost

## Key Bug Fixes Validated

### 1. The October 26 Service Bug
**Problem:** Availabilities for "Culte du dimanche 26 octobre" were being cleared/reset when updating.

**Fix Validated:**
- Updates preserve all existing availabilities
- Null/undefined availabilities are handled safely
- Member data is properly synced after updates

### 2. Data Loss Prevention
**Tests confirm:**
- No data loss during concurrent updates
- Proper handling of undefined/null availabilities
- Correct merging of availability updates
- Atomic operations (all-or-nothing updates)

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all tests once
npm run test:unit -- --run

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:unit

# Run specific test file
npm run test:unit -- tests/unit/members.spec.ts

# Run with coverage

```

## Test Environment

- **Framework:** Vitest v0.34.6
- **Test Utils:** @vue/test-utils
- **Mocking:** Vitest vi.mock for Firebase and dependencies
- **Assertions:** Vitest expect API

## Continuous Integration

These tests should be run:
1. On every pull request
2. Before deploying to production
3. As part of the CI/CD pipeline

## Future Test Improvements

1. Add integration tests with real Firebase emulator
2. Add e2e tests for the complete availability flow
3. Add performance tests for large datasets
4. Add visual regression tests for UI components
5. Add test coverage reporting to CI pipeline
