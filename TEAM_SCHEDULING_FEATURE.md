# Team Scheduling View Feature

## Overview

A new comprehensive team scheduling view that allows team leaders and admins to see all team members' availability and manage assignments for upcoming services in one place.

## Features Implemented

### 1. TeamSchedulingView Component (`/src/views/teams/TeamSchedulingView.vue`)

**Purpose:** Centralized view for managing team scheduling and assignments

**Key Features:**
- **Service Filtering:** Filter services by "√Ä venir" (upcoming), "Ce mois" (this month), or "Tous" (all)
- **Team Member Availability Display:** Shows each team member's availability status for each service
- **Assignment Management:** Allow team leaders/admins to assign and unassign members
- **Visual Status Indicators:** Color-coded cards and chips for different availability states
- **Summary Statistics:** Shows available/assigned counts per service

**Availability States:**
- ‚úÖ **Available:** Member marked as available (green)
- ‚ùå **Unavailable:** Member marked as unavailable (gray)
- ‚ùì **No Response:** Member hasn't responded yet (dashed border)
- üéØ **Assigned:** Member is assigned to the service (success green)

### 2. Navigation Integration

**Route Added:** `/team-scheduling/:id` ‚Üí `TeamSchedulingView.vue`

**Access Points:**
- **Team Detail Page:** New primary "Planning de l'√©quipe" button (solid fill)
- Preserves existing "Voir les disponibilit√©s" and "Voir les assignations" buttons

### 3. Permissions System

**Assignment Management Access:**
- **Admins:** Full access to assign/unassign members
- **Team Owners:** Can manage assignments for their team
- **Team Leaders:** Can manage assignments for their team
- **Regular Members:** View-only access

### 4. Assignment Operations

**Assign Member:**
- Only available for members marked as "available"
- One-click assignment with immediate UI feedback
- Stores assignment in Firebase with audit trail

**Unassign Member:**
- One-click removal for assigned members
- Immediate UI update with confirmation toast

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Reuse

The TeamSchedulingView now **reuses the same logic and UI components** as the main SchedulingView:

- **SchedulingStore:** Leverages the existing Pinia store for state management
- **Shared Components:** Uses EventSelector and TeamCard components
- **Consistent UI:** Maintains the same visual design and interaction patterns
- **Filter Logic:** Shows only the current team's data from the global scheduling view

### Data Flow

1. **Initialize Store:** Uses the existing schedulingStore for data management
2. **Load Services:** Leverages the existing service loading logic
3. **Filter by Team:** Filters the global team data to show only the current team
4. **Real-time Updates:** Uses the same assignment management as the main view

### Key Components Reused

- **EventSelector:** Service selection dropdown (reused from SchedulingView)
- **TeamCard:** Team member display and assignment management (reused)
- **SchedulingStore:** Centralized state management (reused)
- **Assignment Logic:** Same assignment/unassignment operations (reused)

### Benefits of Reuse

- **Consistency:** Same UI/UX as the main scheduling view
- **Maintainability:** Changes to scheduling logic apply to both views
- **Performance:** Leverages existing optimized store and components
- **Feature Parity:** All scheduling features work the same way
